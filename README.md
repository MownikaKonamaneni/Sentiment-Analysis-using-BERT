# Sentiment Analysis using BERT
 
## Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of 1 million tweets using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) from TensorFlow in the Python language. The objective is to classify the sentiment of each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral. 

## Project Description
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique used to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed in text data. In this project, we leverage the power of BERT, a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, to analyze the sentiment of a large dataset consisting of 1 million tweets.

By applying BERT to the dataset, we can obtain fine-grained sentiment predictions for each tweet. The project involves preprocessing the text data, fine-tuning the BERT model on the dataset, and evaluating its performance. The ultimate goal is to create a robust sentiment analysis model that can accurately classify the sentiment of tweets at scale.
